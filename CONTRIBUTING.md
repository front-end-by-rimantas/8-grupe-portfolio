## How to contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/front-end-by-rimantas/8-grupe-portfolio/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/front-end-by-rimantas/8-grupe-portfolio/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to project](https://github.com/front-end-by-rimantas/8-grupe-portfolio/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.
